When it comes to web development, security is of utmost importance. One of the most popular methods of securing web applications is through authentication and authorization. This is where tokens and cookies come into play. In this article, we will discuss two of the most commonly used authentication methods: JWT tokens and cookies.

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be used to securely authenticate users, verify their identity, and provide access to authorized resources.
- JWTs are composed of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically contains the type of the token (JWT), and the signing algorithm used. The payload contains the data being transmitted, such as the user's ID or email address. The signature is created by hashing the header and payload using a secret key, which can be used to verify the authenticity of the token.
- When a user logs into a web application, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client as a response. The client can then include the JWT in the headers of subsequent requests to the server. The server can verify the authenticity of the token by checking the signature and decoding the payload.
- JWTs are commonly used in Single Sign-On (SSO) systems, where a user can authenticate once and access multiple web applications without having to re-enter their credentials. They are also used in token-based authentication systems, where the token is used instead of a username
and password.

### Cookies
- Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer when they visit a website. They are commonly used to store user preferences, shopping cart items, and session data. Cookies can also be used for authentication and authorization.
- When a user logs into a web application, the server can create a cookie that contains a unique identifier for the user's session. This cookie can then be sent to the client as a response. The client can include the cookie in subsequent requests to the server, allowing the server to identify the user and provide access to authorized resources.
- Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. Session cookies are stored in memory and are deleted when the user closes their browser. Persistent cookies are stored on the user's computer and are not deleted when the user closes their browser.
- Cookies have some disadvantages, including the fact that they can be easily tampered with and that they can be blocked by the user's browser. They also require additional server-side processing to store and retrieve the cookie data.

### Conclusion

JWT tokens and cookies are both popular methods of authentication and authorization in web development. JWTs are self-contained and can
be easily transmitted between parties, while cookies are stored on the user's computer and require additional server-side processing. Both
methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and developers should choose the method that best fits their application's security and
performance needs.
